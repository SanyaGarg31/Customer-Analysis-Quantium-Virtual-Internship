# Customer-Analysis-Quantium-Virtual-Internship
Data Analysis for Quantium’s data partnership with a supermarket brand to provide insights relate to customers and products, and make strategic decisions. Skills such as data validation, data visualization, statistical testing, programming, critical and commercial thinking were involved.

Task 1 - For the Data sets 'Transaction Data' and 'Purchase Behavior'
Examine the Data Sets, look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If you determine any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to your analysis. 
In your analysis make sure you define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. 
Define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis. 

Task 2 - Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Product and Brand Recommendation
Examining the performance in trial vs control stores to provide a recommendation for each location based on our insight. Select control stores, explore the data and define metrics for your control store selection – think about what would make them a control store. Look at the drivers and make sure you visualise these in a graph to better determine if they are suited.
Assessment of the trial to get some interesting insights into each of the stores, check each trial store individually in comparison with the control store to get a clear view of its overall performance. Summarise your findings for each store and provide an recommendation that we can share with Julia outlining the impact on sales during the trial period.

Task 3 - Analytics and Commercial Application
Using the “Pyramid Principles” framework, prepare a final report with insights and recommendations that can be used when developing the strategic plan for the next year.
